# Homelab

Welcome to my Homelab project, a dynamic and scalable infrastructure built on Hetzner Cloud using Terraform, Ansible,
and K3s. This setup is designed to host a variety of personal services and experimental projects, providing a flexible
and cost-effective platform for learning and development.

The infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform, which allows for easy scaling and management of Hetzner Cloud resources.
Ansible is employed for configuration management, ensuring consistent setup across all nodes and simplifying the installation
of K3s, a lightweight Kubernetes distribution. This combination of tools enables rapid deployment and modification of the
homelab environment, making it ideal for hosting both established services and new applications developed in my free time.
The use of K3s provides a robust container orchestration platform, allowing for efficient resource utilization and simplified
application deployment.
